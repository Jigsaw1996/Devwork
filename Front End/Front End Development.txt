	Here we will look into how web pages are structures and achieve an effective and clear design. 
	
	
1.1 HTML Refresh

	HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
	
	The extention is .html
	
	It's used to provide structure and content to electronic documents, typically viewed in web browsers. 
	
	I've covered all this before and can all be viewed in the HTML guide, but lets have a short refresh. 

	A typical HTML Document
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>Page Title</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>My Page</h1>
			<p>A paragraph</p>
			
	MOZILLA HAVE KINDLY PROVIDED AN ENTIRE LIST OF HTML ELEMENTS.

1.2 Coding In An Editor

	The most popular editor at the moment is Sublime Text.

	A few notes on files -
	- Don't save files with spaces.
	- Remember to keep git updated with changes. 
	- Sublime has a view in browser option on right click. Use it.
