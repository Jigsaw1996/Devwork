	I will be using this document to note down everything that I have been learning in order to complete my Front End Developer Course.

1 GITHUB

	Git and Github are tools used for development. It is commonly used for building and sharing software. 
	
	It allows for version control, letting a team work on the same files and different versions during completion of a project.
	
	So 2 people can work on a document at the same time, merge them together and then use older versions if necessary to correct mistakes etc.
	
	
1.1 Git

	Git is a tool that allows developers to version their software. When developers are building software, they will need to break it into chunks of work.

	For example, if a developer is to build an authentification mechanism that allows users to sign up and log in, they will need to break this task down. 
	
	This includes developing the signup and login stages. 
	
	Once a developer completes each stage, they will commit that code to the Git repository. This enables developers to track their progress as they develop an application. 
	
	For info on installing Git, see the Git Guide. 
	
	Git is ran through a command line, the info of which is also provided in the Git guide.
