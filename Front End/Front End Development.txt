	Here we will look into how web pages are structures and achieve an effective and clear design. 
	
	
1.1 HTML Refresh

	HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
	
	The extention is .html
	
	It's used to provide structure and content to electronic documents, typically viewed in web browsers. 
	
	I've covered all this before and can all be viewed in the HTML guide, but lets have a short refresh. 

	A typical HTML Document
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>Page Title</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>My Page</h1>
			<p>A paragraph</p>
			
	MOZILLA HAVE KINDLY PROVIDED AN ENTIRE LIST OF HTML ELEMENTS.

1.2 Coding In An Editor

	The most popular editor at the moment is Sublime Text.

	A few notes on files -
	- Don't save files with spaces.
	- Remember to keep git updated with changes. 
	- Sublime has a view in browser option on right click. Use it.
	
	
1.3 The Box Model

	Web Pages are comprised of HTML and CSS elements. Positioning these elements on a web page allows you to have complete control over how the page looks.
	
	Here we will look at how to control layout. 
	
	When discussing web design and layout, the "Box Model" os the collective term that is used to describe how elements are spaced on the page.
	
	The box model of an element works like the below. 
	
	Content Area
	Padding
	Border
	Margin
	Total Width
	
	See the box model example to see how this works.
