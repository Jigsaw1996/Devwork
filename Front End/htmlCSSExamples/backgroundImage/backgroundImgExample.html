		<p>As you can see, the two types of background sizing produces different results.</p>
		<p><strong>Contain</strong> - Makes the image fit the correct width and fit the whole image in, though it may not cover perfectly and may have to mess with aspect ratios.
		<p><strong>Cover</strong> - Makes an image cover the entire container, though the image may cut off to make this happen.</p> 
		<p>Additionally the paralax square shows how backgrounds can be fixed in order to have it stick during scrolling. This requires a high quality image to scroll naturally.</p>
		<p>There is also an additional container with two images, one underneath the other. The last shows how one can overlap another.</p>
		<p>In order for overlapping to work as intended, the layer closest to the screen must be declared first.</p>
