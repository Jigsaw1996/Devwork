		<h1>Display Examples</h1>
		<h2>Block Level</h2>
		<p>Block level elements, such as paragraphs and divs, take up their full line, only allowing one element as part of it's row of content.</p>
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<div class="blockExample">
			<p>Despite only taking up 40% of the container, I take up my full row. Any further content will be on a new row.</p>
		</div>
		<p>As you can see, I'm on a new line.</p>
		<h2>Inline Level</h2>
		<p>Inline level elements only take up the row space that they need to. Inline level elements include anchor tags, strong tags and spans.</p>
		<p>Inline elements can be placed within block level elements, but this can't be done vice versa. They can't be resized.</p> 
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<p>The line doesn't cut off after <a href="">this</a> anchor tag, because it is inline and only uses the line space necessary.</p>
		<p>The same goes for <strong>strong</strong>, <em>Emphasis</em> and spans (used for styling parts of text elements).</p>
		<h2>Inline-Block Level</h2>
		<p>Inline-Block level elements are a mix of the two other levels above. They only take up necessary line spacing, but can have their width/height changed. An example of this is the image tag.</p>
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<p>Here is an image which has been resized. - <img src="img/cat.jpg" alt="Cat" /></p>
		<p>As you can see, the img doesn't appear on a new line, but can still be resized like block level elements.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I used the vertical-align property to make the image appear in the middle of it's line.</p>
